# Test GraphQL scalar type as function input
# This tests that string literals can be used as custom scalar types

# Call a query that takes a URL scalar as input
pub result = fetchURL(url: "https://example.com")

# The query should accept the string literal directly
assert { result == "Fetched: https://example.com" }

print("Scalar input tests passed!")

# Test lambda expressions

# Simple lambda
pub identity = \x -> x
pub add_one = \x -> x

# Note: We can't actually call lambdas without function call support
# For now, just test that lambdas can be defined and assigned

# Lambda with string
pub string_lambda = \s -> s

# Lambda with multiple params (if supported)
# pub add = \(x, y) -> x  # May not work without proper syntax

print("Lambda expression tests passed!")
